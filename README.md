# E-Learning Platform

A full-stack web application for online education that allows students to enroll in courses, study structured theory content, and practice with both timed and untimed quizzes. The platform includes a teacher's cabinet where instructors can create, edit, and manage their courses. Built with Django REST Framework on the backend and React with Vite on the frontend.

### For Students

## Overview

This application provides a complete learning management system where students can browse available courses, enroll in them, study theoretical materials, and test their knowledge through practice quizzes. Teachers have dedicated tools to create and manage courses, modules, and topics. The platform supports both timed and untimed test modes, tracks student progress, and maintains a history of all attempts.

The system features a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices, includes dark theme support, and allows users to customize their profiles with background gradients and avatars.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Backend (`backend/.env`):**
- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` - Django secret key (generate with: `python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"`)
- `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT` - PostgreSQL settings
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth credentials

**Frontend (`frontend/.env`):**
- `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth Client ID (same as backend)

**Important:** Never commit `.env` files to Git. They are already in `.gitignore`.

## Development Notes

- The application uses JWT tokens stored in cookies for authentication (with cookie consent banner)
- Cookie consent is required on first visit - users must accept cookies to continue
- Google OAuth authentication via `django-allauth` - accounts are automatically linked by email
- GitHub OAuth authentication is also supported
- Image uploads are handled via FormData and stored in `backend/media/users/` (for avatars) and `backend/media/courses/` (for course images)
- Profile background gradients are stored as CSS gradient strings
- Course slugs are automatically generated from titles and made unique
- Course images are displayed in course cards and detail pages
- Teacher permissions are enforced via the `IsTeacher` permission class
- All teacher operations are filtered to only show/modify courses created by the current user
- Course editing interface supports inline module and topic creation/editing
- Modules and topics can be added and edited directly on the course edit page
- Time limit configuration: 30 seconds minimum, 30 minutes (1800 seconds) maximum
- Time limit input uses separate fields for minutes (0-29) and seconds (0-59)
- Navigation is locked during timed tests with a visual notification banner
- Full internationalization (i18n) support for English and Slovak languages
- All user-facing text is translatable via LanguageContext
- Course cards in teacher's cabinet show course images with dropdown menus for Edit/Delete actions

## Next Steps After Setup

1. Create `.env` files for backend and frontend (see Configuration section)
2. Configure Google OAuth in Google Cloud Console
3. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
4. Start backend: `python manage.py runserver`
5. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
6. Test authentication: Register, Login, Google OAuth

See `explaining_account_linking.md` for detailed explanation of how account linking works (in Russian).

## Recent Updates

### Teacher's Cabinet Improvements

- **Inline Module and Topic Management**: Modules and topics can now be added and edited directly on the course edit page without navigating to separate pages

- **Time Limit Configuration**: Improved time limit input with separate fields for minutes (0-29) and seconds (0-59), with validation for 30 seconds to 30 minutes range
- **CRUD Operations**: Fixed issues with saving modules and topics, ensuring proper data serialization and backend processing
- **Data Persistence**: Modules and topics now correctly receive IDs after saving and are properly displayed after page reload

### Internationalization

- **Full i18n Support**: Complete translation coverage for English and Slovak languages
- **Status Labels**: All learning status labels (Not started, In progress, Completed, Failed, Passed) are now properly translated
- **OAuth Buttons**: Google and GitHub authentication buttons display translated text based on selected language
- **Credits Page**: Fully translated credits page with footer links

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Theme Selectors**: Unified theme switching buttons across landing, login, and register pages

## Future Development Plans

The platform is under active development. Planned features include:

1. User discussions and comments under theoretical content
2. Integration of an online Python code interpreter
3. Support for coding practice questions in addition to multiple-choice
4. In-app shop system for purchasing courses or additional features
5. Enhanced profile features and customization options
